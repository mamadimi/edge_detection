Image convolution with Sobel, prewitt and LoG(Laplacian of Gaussian) masks for edge detection.
Lines detection using Hough (r,theta) matrix with specific thresholds.
Apply the methods to two test images illinois.mat and sahpes.mat .

demo3a : shapes.mat loading and edges detection with the aboves masks.
demo3b : illinois.mat loading and edges detection using local search.
demo3c : illinois.mat loading, edges detection with LoG mask and Hough matrix calculation.
demo 3d: lines detection to above images. Drawing the lines to a new images.

The results are :
